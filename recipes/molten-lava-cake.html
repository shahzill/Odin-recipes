    <p>Ingridients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup IdahoanÂ® Boxed Original Mashed Potatoes, dry</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.</li>
        <li>In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter.</li>
        <li>In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter.</li>
        <li>Alternative: Use a medium size stainless bowl that sits on top 
            of a small saucepan (with water in saucepan) if you do not have a 
            double boiler. Do not let any water get into the melting chocolate.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and cool.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl beat eggs with hand mixer for several minutes and thoroughly foamy.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, dry mashed potatoes, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, espresso 
            powder and salt. Beat a couple of minutes to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the melted chocolate mixture and beat for five minutes. This recipe works best if lots 
            of air is incorporated into the mixture to make the cakes light and airy.</li>
        <li>Pour into ramekins. DO NOT under bake or over bake the cakes. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes. 
            Keep your eye on them; you want them to be molten (a bit soft in the middle), but not too much.</li>
        <li>Let them rest a few minutes before serving. The center may sink a little - don't worry.</li>
        <li>Run a thin knife around the inside edge to help release the cakes.</li>
        <li>Top with powdered sugar and whip cream.</li>
    </ol>
